# Laboratory 1

[Condition](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/tree/master/lab%231)
# Solution
In this laboratory work I created an Android Application with some custom and default elements.
I fixed in the center a default TextView.
All elements will change their properties like text style,color, dimension when user will press any custom or default button.
I give to all elemnts and "id" that helped me to manipulate with them when I wanted to change some attributes.
I choose Programming Style Guideline Cammel Case, because It is used by Android Studio and JAVA and I find it easy to implement and use.

# Conclusion
After finishing this laboratory work, I got familiarized with Android Studio and git. I learned how to positioned elements using "Linear Layout" and also I understand how to create differents elements like buttons, text edit and so on, using code, also how to modify them from that code in .XML file.
